# Forum
.NET HTTP/HTML Forum server

The server will not work correctly if mainpage.html and threadpage.html are not in the server's PWD.

# TODO
Add file uploading.  
Add physical file retrieval.  
Add some CSS styling.

Uses my [HTTP Server](https://github.com/MrDoritos/HTTP-Server) as its backbone  
Uses very little javascript (adding session token cookie)
